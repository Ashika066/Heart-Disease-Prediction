# Heart-Disease-Prediction

<h1>Overview</h1>

Developed a project to predict cardiac disease using a Logistic Regression machine learning model. The model is trained with fivefold cross-validation to split the data, ensuring robust training and testing. The goal is to achieve the best accuracy and understand the model's behavior in predicting heart disease.

<h1>Key Features</h1>

Logistic Regression Model: Utilizes logistic regression for binary classification of heart disease presence.

Fivefold Cross-Validation: Splits data into five subsets to train and test the model, optimizing performance.

Model Accuracy: Achieved high accuracy by fine-tuning the model with cross-validation.

Data Analysis: Comprehensive analysis of features contributing to heart disease prediction.

<h1>Technologies Used</h1>

Python: For data processing and model building.

NumPy & pandas: For handling data operations and manipulation.

scikit-learn: For implementing the logistic regression model and cross-validation.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualizing data and model performance.
